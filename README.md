# cs224n
This repository contains my attempts of the Stanford course CS224N programming assignments.

I'm following the course from [Winter 2020](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/) and the lectures uploaded on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z).

To maintian the notebooks, I'm using Deepnote, find it [here](https://beta.deepnote.com/project/3c3bf10a-2dbe-4f24-a178-22c9bc054009).
